<p  style="font-size: 160%;">Jacob Harry Maguire (born 5 March 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Premier League club Manchester United and the England national team.

Maguire came through the youth system at Sheffield United before graduating to the first team in 2011. He totalled 166 professional games for the club and was their Player of the Year three consecutive times, also featuring in the PFA Team of the Year for League One as many times. In 2014, he transferred to Hull City for £2.5 million, who loaned him to Wigan Athletic in 2015. He joined Leicester City in 2017 for an initial fee of £12 million. Two years later, he moved to Manchester United for a fee believed to be £80 million, a world-record amount for a defender, and within six months was appointed the club captain.

Maguire played one match for England under-21 in 2012. In October 2017, he made his senior debut and he was chosen for the England's squads for 2018 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2020, earning a place in the Team of the Tournament in the latter. He is currently one of the most renowned footballers in the world and deserves to be part of the best. </p>
